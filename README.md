# 🌸 SheCodes Basics – Week 1: HTML & CSS Fundamentals

Welcome to my first project from the SheCodes Basics workshop!  
This week focused on mastering the building blocks of the web — **HTML and CSS** — along with developer tools and best practices for clean, semantic code.

---

## 💡 What I Learned

### 🧱 HTML
- Elements, attributes, and proper structure
- Containers and semantic tags (like `<div>`, `<section>`, `<header>`)
- Using classes to target elements for styling

### 🎨 CSS
- Selectors, properties, and custom colour palettes
- Positioning, spacing, and border styling
- Intro to pseudo-selectors like `:hover`

### 🧰 Developer Tools & Workflow
- Using **VS Code** effectively
- Formatting code with **Prettier**
- Inspecting elements and testing styles in the browser
- Working with **Slack** as a collaborative dev tool

## 🛠️ Project Details

This repo contains the code for a basic web page built during Week 1, styled with custom CSS and using the principles introduced by instructor **Matt Delac**.

**Files:**
- `index.html` – the main structure of the page  
- `style.css` – the styling and layout logic  

---

## 🌱 Next Steps

> As I continue the course, I’ll improve this page by adding:

- Responsive layouts using media queries
- More advanced CSS (Flexbox, Grid)
- GitHub Pages deployment

---

## 🌐 Live Demo

📌 Coming soon via GitHub Pages!  
This project will be published as a live, hosted site once Week 1 is complete.

---

## 📸 Screenshot (To Be Added)

A screenshot of the final layout will be added here once the full styling is complete.

## 📚 About This Course

SheCodes is an international coding school for women, and I'm currently fast-tracking the **SheCodes Basics** workshop with the goal of finishing the full curriculum in 3 months.  
This project is the first step in my journey toward becoming a frontend developer and Python automation expert.
